Hi, my name is Martina and I am more of a dog person than a cat person.
I have a Jack Russell Terrier named Peanut, which my siblings and I have raised since he was a 3-week-old puppy.
I was blessed with his existence back in September of 2017.
I like to play the keyboard and ukulele, where my go to songs to play are either recent pop songs that I learn or usually ballads. One other thing is that I never fail to sing or hum a tune at least once a day.

<h1>MY INTEREST IN IT</h1>
<p>
I started in the field of commerce when I first started university after high school, but I always had a small interest in the field of information technology. I know how prominent IT is in our world and over the years, coding became this huge skill that everyone was learning. I was interested but hesitant to start learning how to code, so really, I took the chance and switched courses to start at RMIT in the Bachelor of Information Technology in the first semester of 2021.
</p>
<p> My understanding in IT is basic. I grew up with technology all around me, but never understood how any of it really worked. I am naturally a curious person, and love to have somewhat of an understanding of how things work, so one reason is my eagerness to learn about the ‘world of IT.’

</p>
<p>
The first time that I ever really considered a path in IT was during a typical high school assembly.  We had a panel of very successful and influential Australian women in IT as guest speakers for one certain morning. Their fields of expertise were very different, where one was working in NAB, a large corporation, and the other was the CEO of her own start-up that was thriving, from what I can remember at the time. They spoke with so much passion about their journeys and their career pathways, and I remember feeling so empowered that these women were doing so well in a male-dominated field. That was when the seed of interest was planted, but it never really surfaced again until I was halfway through my previous degree, questioning whether I was satisfied. Which the ultimate answer was no, and so that is the main reason I am here today.
</p>
<p>
The closest IT experience I have is in my everyday consumption of all the different technologies in the world around me. I chose to come to RMIT as I have had some family members who have personally recommended the programs here, so when I investigated this program and a few others, I liked it and was gaining interest in them. It also helps that RMIT is situated close to the heart of Melbourne.
</p>
<p>
One thing I am looking forward to is being able to code by the end of degree. I want to be able to get my hands on to creating something with coding and, hopefully see it run properly and purposefully. By the end of my degree, I expect to have built a set of skills that matches an industry of work that I will be interested in, and for it to be enough for me to get a stable income. I also hope to be a better team player, with better communication and time management, when it comes to group assignments throughout my course.

<p>

This position is located overseas, specifically in New York where I would love to live and work for a short period of my life. It is not a permanent job but something that I would love to happen at one point in my future. What appeals me to this position is that it is within the healthcare industry, where I would be able to see the tangible effects that some of the work that I would do will have. The opportunity to work on something meaningful, that changes people’s life in real time is a bonus that would teach me compassion and kindness constantly. The position of a programmer systems analyst at the company for MetroPlus, Health Plan, works closely with healthcare providers to create programs that facilitate in the care they provide. It would involve working in a team to create programs and applications that helps to record and track the systems of healthcare providers in a digitally streamlined way. It would also involve finding hiccups in the systems that need rectifying to make the process of healthcare provider’s jobs more simple but still effective.
I would need an understanding of the healthcare system to work alongside healthcare providers to gain an accurate perspective of their pain points as users of certain programs or applications. I would need to understand the business models of MetroPlus in order to tailor to their needs. I would need to have lots of experience in coding multiple languages, know how to create extremely secure databases that can store large quantities of health data and good communication and analytical skills to find out what the problems in the current systems are through surveys and observation.
</p>
<p> As of present, I only have retail and hospitality skills and experience. I can confidently communicate with customers and provide assistance when necessary. I can work well in a team setting where I would be reporting to someone above me and know how to stay organised in order to maintain productivity in a large group. I know how to create formal reports and have a wide vocabulary that can concisely explain processes, solutions and problems. I have no qualifications but, in the near future, once I complete this degree, I will have a Bachelor of Information Technology.
</p>
<p> The plan would be to finish and graduate with a Bachelor of Information Technology while working a part time job in a large corporation for the experience of management of a large employee database. Once graduated, I hope to find a position in a rewarding graduate program that would teach me the skills to become a business analyst, working for a large agency or corporation, where I will gain invaluable skills and experience through working on multiple projects for a few years. I would then begin to apply overseas, such as in New York or even in Canada to work as a programmer or systems analyst temporarily. Obviously, all of this will require constant learning and adaptability on my end, but my motivation comes from being able to work hands on with everything and getting my hands into any exciting project.

<h1>PERSONALITY PROFILE</h1>
<p>
Myers-Briggs test results: ISFP-A- adventurer </p>
<p>
Online learning style test results: Tactile learner 45%, auditory 30%, visual 25% </p>
<p>
Big Five Personality test results: 67 in Factor III, 62 in emotional stability, 46 in conscientiousness, 33 in extroversion, 2 in intellect/imagination </p>


<h2> What do the results of these tests mean for you? </h2>
<p1> To me these test results show how I am not a big fan of being told what to do in life, and how important it is for me to have creative freedom or flexibility in a job. It confirms that I am a diligent worker when I am given a task, and that I would work hard to earn appreciation. It also suggests that I am someone who prefers harmony in my life, and for my relationships in generally to be non-judgmental and emotionally stable. To me it does show that I am able to work well in a group setting.</p1>

<h2> How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </h2>

<p1> In a team, I would be diligent and hardworking, but one challenge would be to show leadership if the moment presents itself. I would be a reliable teammate, who would prefer a harmonious working relationship with my fellow peers and would try to solve problems as they come. I would mostly work within the conventions of the tasks required but would also go on unproductive as I do enjoy satisfying my curiosity in the moment and can get hyper focused on an insignificant case. </p1>
<h2>
How should you take this into account when forming a team? </h2>
<p1>
What I would need to consider when forming a team is finding agreeable teammates who are easy-going, reliable and independent. A team who is diligent and supportive is ideal as my personality does tend to work hard to complete tasks at hand and would rather have people with a similar work ethic and will appreciate acknowledgement and celebration after completion of said tasks. I am also able to stay focused with short term goals over long term goals, so I would need guidance and support to keep me motivated in projects that take time. One other thing would be finding a group that has a balance of fun and seriousness in the work we do, as I am someone who also needs breaks frequently between periods of focus.

</p>

<h1> PROJECT IDEA </h1>

<h2> Overview </h2>

<p>The project is to create an aesthetic and simplistic application/ program that is a system that connects all of somebody’s finances (such as banking apps to things like afterpay and beem it) into one place to create visuals, such as graphs, to understand a user’s cash managing behaviours. For example, it will allow a person to identify a category that has the highest expenditure and track either unhealthy or healthy spending habits of theirs. The purpose is to report and identify good cash management to the user and help to improve their money management for a more financially literate population. </p>
<h2> Motivation </h2>

<p> Reaching the age of 20 and over comes with more responsibilities, and in particular financial responsibilities. It is important for individuals to be financially literate and know the basic flows of their income and expenses, but with other commitments in life, sometimes it is difficult to stay on top of this mundane task. As a tertiary student, often it is the most minimalistic and low effort designs of applications or even services that draws me in to use them. If there is the option of a more convenient and efficient method or a conventional and slower method, the obvious choice would be to choose the former. Thus, a simplified and accessible application that does all the planning and organising of a personal budget is a very much needed service in my opinion.</p>

<h2> Description </h2>

<p> The app would connect all the different financial accounts that a user has, such as debit, credit and even investment accounts, and will refine all the transactions into specific categories of expenditure or income. One necessary feature for the application, particularly garnered towards students, would be to distinguish what transfers are for by using an easy categorising system. So, usually what happens on nights out is a friend would pay the whole bill, while everyone else would transfer back their respective amount to the said friend. These small transactions add up and this application should be able to instantly distinguish what the payment was for based on something like a quick description on the transaction, making the recording for budgeting purposes a lot easier. It should be able to streamline and accurately categorise all different transactions on all different platforms by analysing the data entered from other applications such as beem it, afterpay or paypal with minimal to no manual edits by the user. It would then help a person basically see all their inflows versus outflows with more accuracy, as trying to remember a small insignificant amount transferred over a week ago is very difficult. Having a one stop shop application allows seamless integration of all cash flows and allows better cash management which is a very important life skill.</p>

<p> The app would give further insights, such as totalling how much was being spent where and will provide suggestions to reduce spending in some areas. The application/software needs to be extremely simplistic and minimal to attract more users. It will be able to show necessary information such as all transactions under certain categories or a general total weekly/monthly cash inflow versus cash outflows, in multiple formats like pie graphs, bar graphs or other visually appealing methods. The app should also allow for extraction of information for specific requests too so allowing the user to pick and choose what they want to find is a must as well. </p>


<p> It would also include the option to set reminders for when a spending limit has been reached or when usual bills or subscriptions are expected to be paid for during a month. As students, we like to see information that is easily digestible and simplistic so making the application overall extremely minimal, aesthetically pleasing and easy to use is an extremely important part of this application/software. </p>

<h2> Tools and Technologies </h2>

<p> Obviously because this application would be dealing with sensitive information such as banking details, passwords and account details, it requires utmost security of data. This will also come with lots of legalities that will need to be dealt with before anything could be started. The app would run on both ios and android but would also need to be accessible on desktops too.

<h2> Skills Required </h2>

<p> The understanding of basic banking and financing will be needed.  The ability to code a program on swift for an ios app and in java for android and to be able to create a website that can also run on desktop will be required too. The system would require a secure database that can hold all the information that users provide and would need extremely high security to make sure it is safe and trustworthy. In honesty, a large-scale version is not feasible for a beginner like myself but the logic behind it can perhaps be simplified and created. </p> 

<h2> Outcome </h2>
<p> If the project is successful, many more people will be able to accurately view their cash management and improve on this important life skill. It will help to highlight unhealthy spending habits, and hopefully help generally younger users to learn healthy cash management skills. The problem of being fearful and lazy to take care of personal finances will be resolved and it will help educate and train a larger population of millennials to become more money smart.
